# Recommendation model using cosine similarity

In this project I will develop a model that will be able to recommend job’s advertisement based on a certain CV. I could divide the project into three parts:
1.	Scraping Data using Selenium and Beautiful soup.
2.	Developing the recommendation model using Cosine Similarity
3.	Sending emails attached the links of the recommended jobs

The page that I picked for this step is the Indeed platform, I would like to emphasize that the whole process is for educational reasons with all the respect to companies and data. In addition, you can skip this step and just download some data samples that I saved above the readme section and jump to the Machine learning step.
Firstly, exporting the libraries that we are going to use:
