# Recommendation model using cosine similarity

In this project I will develop a model that will be able to recommend job’s advertisement based on a certain CV. I could divide the project into three parts:
1.	Scraping Data using Selenium and Beautiful soup.
2.	Developing the recommendation model using Cosine Similarity
3.	Sending emails attached the links of the recommended jobs
So let’s start with the first step and analyse the scraping process.
